# Sonar Navigation

In this project, we collected a Spatio-Temporal Ultrasonic Dataset (STUD) to teach the mobile robot to drive in unknown indoor environments autonomously. This is inspired by the phenomenon that bats are able to
navigate in complex environments by extracting spatial and temporal cues from sonar echoes.
